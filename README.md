This repository was created to store the practical works developed during this subject. There are 3 projects:
- TP1: This project is about scheduling, we had to implement 2 round robin schedulers for multiple processors, the first one had dynamic load balancing between cores and the second one, had fixed affinity for new processes which came to the ready queue. We(github/izikiel) also implemented a real time scheduler(EDF) based on relative urgency for real time systems. 
- 
- TP2: This project was about threads and parallel programming, we were given a problem and we had to implement a solution using C with pthreads and semaphores/condition variables, etc to prevent race conditions and deadlocks.
- 
- TP3: This project was about distributed systems and Big Data processing, we implemented Map-Reduce algorithms and ran them over real data to get some statistics about this data.Later, we've made a research about Amazon services which provides a service to process data in the cloud.
